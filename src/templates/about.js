  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Grizzly Gamers was founded by Elizabeth Roeder and the awesome sponsors, Mr. Gabel and Ms. Foster. This is our first year at Grassfield High School and we are excited for this upcoming school year. We have fantastic events planned for our school's tenth anniversary!</p>
  <p>The core of the club is playing videogames. We will have casual gaming, but the prizes are in the competitive leaderboard system. Based on ranked matches and points, the rankings will change weekly. At the end of a season, the points will be recorded and reset for a new season. However, the points will be tracked over the year, and the overall winner at the end will receive the best awards, including their name permanently engraved in our Hall of Fame, a trophy, and possibly money. So gamers, do your best for this school year!</p>
  <p>Grizzly Gamers functions by having teams and team captains, which are organized by the club officers. Members may specify if they would like to play with their friends. You don't have to be the best to play on a competitive team, either! We will balance the teams by placing the best of players with newer people so that teams may develop together. We prioritze having fun with learning and improving!</p>
  <p>Team captains will be the leaders of their respective teams. They will design strategies and communicate with their team. In order to be a team captain, you must be highly competitive and possess a wide understanding of your chosen game. Captains may also request to trade players in order to help balance the ranking systems and competitive play.</p>
  <p>To join our club, a fee of $5 is requested for our end-of-year pizza party. Members must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher. In order to play videogames, members will also need permission to bring and play game systems and game titles. The link to our permission slip is below.</p>
